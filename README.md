# My-Researches# 📚 My-Researches

This repository contains my personal research and technical summaries on topics I study as an engineering student. Each folder includes a LaTeX-written PDF that explores a concept or technology I’ve learned, such as:

- 🤖 Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- 🧠 Machine Learning (ML)
- 🔬 Deep Learning (DL)
- 🧾 Large Language Models (LLMs)
- And more...

It serves as both my **learning notebook** and **public portfolio**.
